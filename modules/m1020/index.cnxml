      We now move on to another three terminal device - also called a
      <term>transistor</term>.  (In truth this device really has at
      least four, and probably five, terminals, but we will leave the
      subtle details for a later time.)  This transistor, however,
      works on much different principles than does the bipolar
      junction transistor of the last chapter.  We will now focus on a
      device called the <term>Field Effect Transistor</term>, or
      <term>Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor</term>
      or simply, the <term>MOSFET</term>.  Consider the following:

      Here we have a block of silicon, doped p-type.  Into it we have
      made two regions which are doped n-type. To each of those n-type
      regions we attach a wire, and connect a battery between them.
      If we try to get some current, <m:math><m:ci>I</m:ci></m:math>,
      to flow through this structure, nothing will happen, because the
      n-p junction on the RHS is reverse biased (We have the positive
      lead from the battery going to the n-side of the p-n junction).
      If we attempt to remedy this by turning the battery around, we
      will now have the LHS junction reverse biased, and again, no
      current will flow.  If, for whatever reason, we want current to
      flow, we will need to come up with some way of forming a layer
      of n-type material between one n-region and the other.  This
      will then connect them together, and we can run current in one
      terminal and out the other.

      To see how we will do this, let's do two things.  First we
      will grow a layer of

	</m:apply>
      </m:math> (silicon dioxide, or just plain "oxide") on top of the
      silicon.  (This turns out to be relatively easy, we just stick
      the wafer in an oven with some oxygen flowing through it, and
      heat everything up to about

	  <m:cn>1100</m:cn>

	  <m:ci>Â°C</m:ci>

      </m:math> for an hour or so, and we end up with a nice,
      high-quality insulating

      </m:math> layer on top of the silicon).  On top of the oxide
      layer we then deposit a conductor, which we call the gate.  In
      the "old days" the gate would have been a layer of aluminum
      (Hence the "metal-oxide-silicon" or MOS name).  Today, it is
      much more likely that a heavily doped layer of polycrystalline
      silicon (polysilicon, or more often just "poly") would be
      deposited to form the gate structure.  (I guess "POS" sounded
      funny to people in the field, because it never caught on as a
      name for these devices).  Polysilicon is made from the reduction
      of a gas, such as silane (

      The silicon is polycrystalline (composed of lots of small
      silicon crystallites) because it is deposited on top of the
      oxide, which is amorphous, and so it does not provide a single
      crystal "matrix" which would allow the silicon to organize
      itself into one single crystal.  If we had deposited the silicon
      on top of a single crystal silicon wafer, we would have formed a
      single crystal layer of silicon called an <term>epitaxial
      layer</term>.  (<term>Epitaxy</term> comes from the Greek, and
      it just means "ordered upon".  Thus an epitaxial layer is one
      which follows the order of the substrate on which it is grown).
      This is sometimes done to make structures for particular
      applications.  For instance, growing a n-type epitaxial layer on
      top of a p-type substrate permits the fabrication of a very
      abrupt p-n junction.
