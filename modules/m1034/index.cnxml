      Starting with a prepared, polished wafer then how do we get an
      integrated circuit? We will focus on the CMOS process, described
      in the last chapter. Let's assume we have wafer which was doped
      during growth so that it has a background concentration of
      acceptors in it (i.e. it is p-type). Referring back to <link document="m1029" target-id="fig46">CMOS Logic</link>, you can see
      that the first thing we need to build is a n-tank or moat. In
      order to do this, we need some way in which to introduce
      additional impurities into the semiconductor. There are several
      ways to do this, but current technology relies almost
      exclusively on a technique called <term>ion
      implantation</term>. A diagram of an ion-implanter is shown in
      the <link document="m1033" target-id="fig05">figure in the
      previous section</link>. An ion implanter uses a dopant source
      gas, ionizes it, and drives the ions into the wafer. The dopant
      gas is ionized and the resultant charged ions are accelerated
      through a magnetic field, where they are mass-analyzed. The
      vertical magnetic field causes the beam of ions to spread out,
      according to their mass. A thin aperture selects the ions of
      interest, and lets them pass, blocking all the others. This
      makes sure we are only implanting the ion we want, and in fact,
      even selects for the proper isotope! The ionized atoms are then
      accelerated through several tens to hundreds of kV, and then
      deflected by an electric field, much like in an oscilloscope
      CRT. In fact, most of the time the ion beam is "rastered" across
      the surface of the silicon wafer. The ions strike the silicon
      wafer and pass into its interior. A measurement of the current
      flow in the system and its integral, is a measure of how much
      dopant was deposited into the wafer. This is usually given in
      terms of the number of dopant

      After the atoms enter the silicon, they interact with the
      lattice, creating defects, and slowing down until finally they
      stop. Typical atomic distributions, as a function of implant
      voltage are show in <link target-id="fig06"/> for implantation into
      amorphous silicon.  When implantation is done on single crystal
      material, channeling, the improved mobility of an ion down the
      "hallway" of a given lattice direction, can skew the impurity
      distribution significantly. Just slight changes of less than a
      degree can make big differences in how the impurity atoms are
      finally distributed in the wafer. Usually, the operator of the
      implant machine purposely tilts the wafer a few degrees off
      normal to the beam in order to arrive at more reproducible
      results.

      As you might expect, shooting 100 kV ions at a silicon wafer
      probably does quite a bit of damage to the crystal
      structure. Not only that, but just having, say boron, in your
      wafer does not mean you are going to have holes. For the boron
      to become "electrically active" - that is to act as an acceptor
      - it has to reside on a silicon lattice site. Even if the boron
      atom does, somehow, end up on an actual lattice site when it
      stops crashing around in the wafer, the many defects which have
      been created will act as deep traps. Thus, the hole which is
      formed will probably be caught at a trap site and will not be
      able to contribute to electrical conductivity in the wafer
      anyway. How can we fix this situation? If we carefully heat up
      the wafer, we can cause the atoms in the crystal to shake
      around, and if we do it right, they all get back where they
      belong. Not only that, but the newly added impurities end up on
      lattice sites as well! This step is called
      <term>annealing</term> and it does just what it is supposed
      to. Typical temperatures and times for such an anneal are 500 to
      1000Â°C for 10 to 30 minutes.
    </para>


    <para id="pa4"> Something else occurs during the anneal step
      however. We have just added, by our implantation step,
      impurities with a fairly tight distribution as shown in <link target-id="fig06"/>. There is an obvious gradient in impurity
      distribution, and if there is a gradient, than things may start
      moving around by diffusion, especially at elevated temperatures.
