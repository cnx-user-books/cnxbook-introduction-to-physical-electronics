      It would probably be interesting to spend a little time seeing
      how integrated circuits are made. This chapter will be long on
      description, and rather short on equations (yay!). This is not
      to say that there is not a lot of analytical work in the IC
      fabrication process. It's just that things get <emphasis>very
      </emphasis>complicated in a hurry, and so we probably are better
      off just looking at most processes from a qualitative point of
      view.

      Let's start out by taking a look at the state of the industry,
      and remark on a few trends. <link target-id="fig01"/> is a plot of
      IC sales in the United States over the past 30 years. This might
      not be a bad field to get into! Maybe there will be a job or two
      out there when you are ready to graduate.

      There has been a steady shift away from bipolar technology to
      MOS as is shown in <link target-id="fig02"/>. Currently, about 90%
      of the market is composed of MOS devices, and only about 10% of
      bipolar. This is likely to be the case for some time to
      come. The change in slope, where MOS starts taking over from
      bipolar at a more rapid rate about 1987 is when CMOS technology
      really started to come into heavy use. At that point, bipolar
      TTL logic essentially faded to zero.

    <para id="p4">
      As you probably are aware, devices have been getting smaller and
      smaller, and chips have been getting bigger and bigger with
      time. A most <link target-id="fig03">impressive plot</link> is one
      which shows the number of components/chip as a function of time.
    </para>

    <para id="p5">
      One of the main drivers for this has been feature size, which
      shows the same nearly exponential behavior as
      components/chip. This is plotted in <link target-id="fig04"/> for
      your education. What is interesting to note about this is that
      certain "doom sayers" have been predicting an abrupt halt to
      this curve for some time now. It stands to reason that you can
      not image something which is finer than
      <m:math><m:mi>Î»</m:mi></m:math>, the wavelength of the
      light you use to project it with. However, by going to the
      ultraviolet, and using a variety of image enhancing techniques,
      lithographic engineers continue to be able to make finer and
      finer structures. </para>
